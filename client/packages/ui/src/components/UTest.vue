    I’m a software developer & UI/UX design enthusiast come from Vietnam.<br /><br />From the fact that developing
    applications using <span class="text-primary-default">JavaScript</span> is very popular nowadays, I really love
    working with <span class="text-primary-default">Vue.JS</span>, and recently interested in
    <span class="text-primary-default">Rust</span> to use it as a back-end language.<br /><br />Besides, I also like
    <span class="text-primary-default">designing UI/UX</span> because I’m a perfectionist, thus I want every single
    component in my applications need to be precise, balanced and ergonomic.
