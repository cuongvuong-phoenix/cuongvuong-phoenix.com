      biography:
        I’m a software developer & UI/UX design enthusiasm come from Vietnam.<br /><br />From the fact that developing
        applications using <span class="text-primary-default">JavaScript</span> is very popular nowadays, I really love
        working with <span class="text-primary-default">Vue.JS</span>, and recently interested in
        <span class="text-primary-default">Rust</span> to use it as a back-end language.<br /><br />Besides, I also like
        <span class="text-primary-default">designing UI/UX</span>. I’m a perfectionist, therefore I want every single
        component in an application need to be precise, balanced and ergonomic.

      vuejs:
        label: Vue.JS
        description:
          Since the release of version 3 and its continuous rising community and improvement of the ergonomic ecosystem,
          <span class="text-secondary-default">Vue.JS</span> has evolved to the point that building web applications with it
          is some kind of a “must” to me.
      rust:
        label: Rust
        description:
          Although I can quickly learn and apply other languages/frameworks, I strongly believe performance and development
          experience are the key factors for any application. <span class="text-secondary-default">Rust</span> is not very
          easy to begin with but it covers things that I demand for!
      uiux-design:
        label: UI/UX Design
        description:
          Every application need an interface that balances between glamour and ease-of-use. I want to give end-users the best
          experience. I also enforce rules and best practices from “coding” when designing with
          <span class="text-secondary-default">Figma</span>, <span class="text-secondary-default">Inkscape</span>.
      database:
        label: Database
        description:
          I graduated from a theory-hard university (Ho Chi Minh city University of Technology), thus I like to work with
          every aspect of a software, including <span class="text-secondary-default">Database</span>. I’m not expert at
          writing SQLs though, just had some experiences and kind of theoretically inclined.
      linux:
        label: Linux
        description:
          'My current setup is running on <span class="text-secondary-default">Arch Linux</span>. I’ve used it as a daily
          driven operating system since 2019. After using it and its wide-range software and applications, my only question
          is: <span class="italic">"Why don’t people all use it now?"</span>.'
      neovim:
        label: Neovim
        description:
          When I first-touched <span class="text-secondary-default">Vi</span>, I couldn’t last for 23 hours!<br />6 months
          later, I revisited it again, now with a clearer mind and with the help of <code>vimtutor</code>, I felt in love with
          it!<br />I extended into <span class="text-secondary-default">Neovim</span> and now almost everything I use has some
          "Vim" in it. Check out
          <a href="https://github.com/vuong-cuong-phoenix/neovim-config" class="underline">my Neovim config</a>.
      learning:
        label: Learning
        description:
          '"Learn, learn more, learn forever!"<br />I love learning new things, specially software and technology related. One
          of my favorite domain that I learned is <span class="italic">Principles of Programming Languages</span> and I
          believe with the help of it, I can learn and use any programming languages easily!'

        description:
          'Whenever I’m working, I listen to soft and chill music such as: <span class="italic">instrumentals, LoFi,...</span
          ><br />Sometimes, I need a dose to boost-up my emotions, so I also listen to
          <span class="italic">Future House</span> and <span class="italic">EDM</span> songs.'
